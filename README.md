The data for this report was sourced from multiple CSV files hosted on a GitHub repository maintained by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. This repository contained time-series data for COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths for both global and US regions, as well as global recovered cases. The individual files were programmatically read and compiled to form the comprehensive dataset utilized for the analysis.
